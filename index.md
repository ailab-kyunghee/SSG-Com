        Surgical scene understanding is crucial for computer-assisted intervention systems, requiring visual comprehension of surgical scenes that involves diverse elements such as surgical tools, anatomical structures, and their interactions. 
        To effectively represent the complex information in surgical scenes, graph-based approaches have been explored to structurally model surgical entities and their relationships. 
        However, aspects such as tool–action–target combinations and the identity of the operating hand remain underexplored. 

        To address this, we propose <b>Endoscapes-SG201</b>, a new dataset including annotations for tool–action–target and hand identity. 
        We also introduce <b>SSG-Com</b>, a graph-based method designed to represent these critical elements. 
        Experiments on downstream tasks—Critical View of Safety (CVS) assessment and action triplet recognition—demonstrate the importance of integrating these scene graph components, significantly advancing holistic surgical scene understanding.

## 🚀 Motivation
Surgical AI systems need a **holistic understanding of surgical scenes**, not just detecting tools and anatomy.  
Previous scene graph approaches overlooked two key aspects:
1. **Tool–Action–Target combinations** (e.g., "grasper–retract–gallbladder")  
2. **Hand identity** (operator’s left/right hand vs. assistant’s hand)

These missing elements are crucial for context-aware modeling in surgical workflows.

## 📊 Endoscapes-SG201 Dataset
We construct **Endoscapes-SG201**, built upon Endoscapes-BBox201:
- **1,933 frames** from **201 laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos**
- **Annotations:**
  - 6 surgical tools: Grasper, Hook, Clipper, Bipolar, Irrigator, Scissors
  - 5 anatomical structures
  - 6 surgical actions (Dissect, Retract, Grasp, Clip, Coagulate, Null)
  - 3 hand identities: Operator-Right, Operator-Left, Assistant
- **Splits:** 1,212 train / 409 val / 312 test frames:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 🧩 Method: SSG-Com
We propose **SSG-Com (Surgical Scene Graph for Comprehensive Understanding)**:
1. **Graph Construction**  
   - Nodes: tools + anatomical structures  
   - Edges: spatial + surgical action edges  
   - Additional classifier for **hand identity**
2. **Learning**  
   - Multi-task training: spatial relations, action edges, hand identity  
   - Loss: \(L_{total} = L_{LG} + \lambda_{action} L_{action} + \lambda_{hand} L_{hand}\):contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
3. **Downstream Tasks**  
   - **CVS Prediction**  
   - **Action Triplet Recognition**

## 📈 Results
![Comparison of methods in triplet recognition and CVS prediction](/static/image/quantitative_result.png)


*SSG-Com consistently outperforms prior methods, especially when incorporating hand identity.*

## 🔍 Qualitative Results
We visualize surgical scene graphs generated by **LG-CVS** and **SSG-Com**:

- **Nodes**: surgical tools & anatomical structures  
- **Edges**:  
  - **Solid straight lines** → spatial relationships (left-right, above-below, inside-outside)  
  - **Dashed curved lines** → action relationships (e.g., grasping, dissecting)  
- **Hand icons** next to tool nodes → indicate operating hand (Rt, Lt, Assistant)

*Figure 3: Comparison of graphs generated by LG-CVS vs. SSG-Com. Our method captures both action relations and hand identity, leading to more contextually rich representations*

## ✨ Contributions
- **New dataset**: Endoscapes-SG201 with fine-grained tool, action, and hand annotations.  
- **New method**: SSG-Com, integrating spatial, action, and hand relations.  
- **Improved performance** on both **triplet recognition** and **CVS assessment**, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines.
