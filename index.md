        <div class="content has-text-justified">
        Surgical scene understanding is crucial for computer-assisted intervention systems, requiring visual comprehension of surgical scenes that involves diverse elements such as surgical tools, anatomical structures, and their interactions. 
        To effectively represent the complex information in surgical scenes, graph-based approaches have been explored to structurally model surgical entities and their relationships. 
        However, aspects such as toolâ€“actionâ€“target combinations and the identity of the operating hand remain underexplored. 

        To address this, we propose <b>Endoscapes-SG201</b>, a new dataset including annotations for toolâ€“actionâ€“target and hand identity. 
        We also introduce <b>SSG-Com</b>, a graph-based method designed to represent these critical elements. 
        Experiments on downstream tasksâ€”Critical View of Safety (CVS) assessment and action triplet recognitionâ€”demonstrate the importance of integrating these scene graph components, significantly advancing holistic surgical scene understanding.

## ðŸš€ Motivation
Surgical AI systems need a **holistic understanding of surgical scenes**, not just detecting tools and anatomy.  
Previous scene graph approaches overlooked two key aspects:
1. **Toolâ€“Actionâ€“Target combinations** (e.g., "grasperâ€“retractâ€“gallbladder")  
2. **Hand identity** (operatorâ€™s left/right hand vs. assistantâ€™s hand)

These missing elements are crucial for context-aware modeling in surgical workflows:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

## ðŸ“Š Endoscapes-SG201 Dataset
We construct **Endoscapes-SG201**, built upon Endoscapes-BBox201:
- **1,933 frames** from **201 laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos**
- **Annotations:**
  - 6 surgical tools: Grasper, Hook, Clipper, Bipolar, Irrigator, Scissors
  - 5 anatomical structures
  - 6 surgical actions (Dissect, Retract, Grasp, Clip, Coagulate, Null)
  - 3 hand identities: Operator-Right, Operator-Left, Assistant
- **Splits:** 1,212 train / 409 val / 312 test frames:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## ðŸ§© Method: SSG-Com
We propose **SSG-Com (Surgical Scene Graph for Comprehensive Understanding)**:
1. **Graph Construction**  
   - Nodes: tools + anatomical structures  
   - Edges: spatial + surgical action edges  
   - Additional classifier for **hand identity**
2. **Learning**  
   - Multi-task training: spatial relations, action edges, hand identity  
   - Loss: \(L_{total} = L_{LG} + \lambda_{action} L_{action} + \lambda_{hand} L_{hand}\):contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
3. **Downstream Tasks**  
   - **CVS Prediction**  
   - **Action Triplet Recognition**

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
### Triplet Recognition (mAP)
| Dataset | Method | Spa. | Act. | Hand | mAP |
|---------|--------|------|------|------|-----|
| Endoscapes-BBox201 | LG-CVS | âœ“ | â€“ | â€“ | 13.8 |
| Endoscapes-SG201 | LG-CVS | âœ“ | â€“ | â€“ | 18.0 |
| Endoscapes-SG201 | **SSG-Com** | âœ“ | âœ“ | âœ“ | **24.2** |

### CVS Prediction (mAP)
| Dataset | Method | mAP |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Endoscapes-BBox201 | LG-CVS | 62.3 |
| Endoscapes-SG201 | **SSG-Com** | **64.6** |

*SSG-Com consistently outperforms prior methods, especially when incorporating hand identity:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.*

## âœ¨ Contributions
- **New dataset**: Endoscapes-SG201 with fine-grained tool, action, and hand annotations.  
- **New method**: SSG-Com, integrating spatial, action, and hand relations.  
- **Improved performance** on both **triplet recognition** and **CVS assessment**, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
