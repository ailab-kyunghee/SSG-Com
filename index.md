        <h5>Abstract</h5>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
        Surgical scene understanding is crucial for computer-assisted intervention systems, requiring visual comprehension of surgical scenes that involves diverse elements such as surgical tools, anatomical structures, and their interactions. 
        To effectively represent the complex information in surgical scenes, graph-based approaches have been explored to structurally model surgical entities and their relationships. 
        However, aspects such as tool–action–target combinations and the identity of the operating hand remain underexplored. 
        To address this, we propose <b>Endoscapes-SG201</b>, a new dataset including annotations for action triplets(tool–action–target) and hand identity. 
        We also introduce <b>SSG-Com</b>, a graph-based method designed to represent these critical elements. 
        Experiments on downstream tasks—Critical View of Safety (CVS) assessment and action triplet recognition—demonstrate the importance of integrating these scene graph components, significantly advancing holistic surgical scene understanding.

  We were fortunate to build <a href="https://github.com/ailab-kyunghee/SSG-Com">Endoscapes-SG201</a>, a dataset for holistic scene graph research, by extending and refining the publicly available <a href="https://github.com/CAMMA-public/Endoscapes">Endoscapes-Bbox201</a> dataset released by CAMMA.
        </div>
</div>

To annotate additional labels, two clinical experts from Samsung Medical Center refined the bounding boxes in Endoscapes-Bbox201.
- **Step 1**: We refined Bounding Boxes from Endoscapes-Bbox201
- **Step 2**: We subdivided the 'Tool' class into 6 classes
- **Step 3**: We annotated Action labels which describes interactions between tools and anatomical structures, and Hand Identity labels which specifies which hand is manipulating each tool

This table contrasts the datasets used in previous surgical scene graph studies with Endoscapes-SG201.

- Endoscapes-SG201 is designed with holistic scene graph research in mind.

- It incorporates:
  - Diverse tools and anatomical structures as graph nodes.
  - Diverse relationships as graph edges.
  - Hand Identity labels as attributes of the tool nodes.

- By unifying these elements, the dataset provides a more expressive and comprehensive foundation for modeling surgical scenes.

This table presents the category-wise distribution of the additional labels introduced in Endoscapes-SG201.

**Additional Annotations:**
- **6 Surgical Instruments**: Hook (HK), Grasper (GP), Clipper (CL), Bipolar (BP), Irrigator (IG), Scissors (SC)
- **6 Surgical Actions**: Dissect (Dis.), Retract (Ret.), Grasp (Gr.), Clip (Cl.), Coagulate (Co.), Null
- **3 Hand Identities**: Operator’s Right Hand (Rt), Operator’s Left Hand (Lt), Assistant’s Hand (Assi)

    <h3>SSG-Com</h3>

</div>

SSG-Com is designed to leverage the diverse labels of Endoscapes-SG201.
1. **Graph Construction**  
   - **Nodes**: Surgical instruments(with Hand identity), Anatomical structures  
   - **Edges**: spatial relations, Surgical action relations  
2. **Learning**  
   - Multi-task training with 3 classifiers
     - Spatial relation classification
     - Action relation classification
     - Hand identity classification  
   - **Total Loss**:  $L_{\text{total}} = L_{\text{LG}} + \lambda_{\text{action}} L_{\text{action}} + \lambda_{\text{hand}} L_{\text{hand}}$

## 📈 Results


*SSG-Com consistently outperforms prior methods, especially when incorporating hand identity.*

---

## 🔍 Qualitative Results
We visualize surgical scene graphs generated by **LG-CVS** and **SSG-Com**:

- **Nodes**: surgical tools & anatomical structures  
- **Edges**:  
  - **Solid straight lines** → spatial relationships (left-right, above-below, inside-outside)  
  - **Dashed curved lines** → action relationships (e.g., grasping, dissecting)  
- **Hand icons** next to tool nodes → indicate operating hand (Rt, Lt, Assistant)

*Figure 3: Comparison of graphs generated by LG-CVS vs. SSG-Com. Our method captures both action relations and hand identity, leading to more contextually rich representations*

## ✨ Contributions
- **New dataset**: Endoscapes-SG201 with fine-grained tool, action, and hand annotations.  
- **New method**: SSG-Com, integrating spatial, action, and hand relations.  
- **Improved performance** on both **triplet recognition** and **CVS assessment**, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines.
